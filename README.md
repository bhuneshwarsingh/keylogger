# keylogger
A keylogger is a powerful software tool designed to monitor and record keystrokes on a computer or mobile device. With its ability to capture every key pressed, a keylogger can track passwords, messages, and other sensitive information entered by users.
A keylogger, also known as keystroke logger, is a software or hardware tool designed to monitor and record the keystrokes typed on a computer or mobile device. It operates in the background, capturing every key pressed by the user, including letters, numbers, special characters, and function keys.
Keyloggers can be implemented in various forms, including software applications, kernel-based drivers, or physical devices inserted between the keyboard and the computer. They can function at different levels of the operating system, allowing them to capture keystrokes from any application or website.
The primary purpose of a keylogger is to track and record keystrokes for different reasons. In legitimate cases, keyloggers are employed for monitoring purposes, such as parental control or employee monitoring, where authorized individuals can use them to supervise computer usage and ensure compliance with policies.
However, keyloggers can also be used maliciously. Cybercriminals may deploy them to steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, personal messages, or other confidential data. This unauthorized usage of keyloggers is a serious privacy violation and can lead to identity theft, financial loss, or other harmful consequences.
It's important to note that the usage of keyloggers without the consent of the device owner is illegal and unethical. It is crucial to respect privacy rights and ensure that keyloggers are used responsibly and within legal boundaries.
